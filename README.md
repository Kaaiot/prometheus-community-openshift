# Kubernetes Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```console
helm repo add kaaiot-charts https://kaaiot.github.io/prometheus-community-openshift
```

You can then run `helm search repo kaaiot-charts` to see the charts.
